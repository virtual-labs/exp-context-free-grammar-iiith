# Derivation from Context-Free Grammar

# Introduction

Having recently explored Pushdown Automata (PDAs) and Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), we can now connect these two concepts and delve into **derivation trees**. Derivation trees provide a visual representation of how a sentence is derived from the start symbol of a CFG, showcasing the step-by-step expansion of non-terminal symbols (don’t worry if you don’t understand these terms yet, the visualizations should clarify these concepts). 

By understanding how PDAs use stack-based memory to simulate the process of expanding non-terminals, we can appreciate how derivation trees capture the hierarchical structure of sentences, highlighting the nested relationships between lower-order structures like phrases and higher-order structures like clauses and sentences. 

In the following sections, we will formally explore production rules, and visualize the construction of derivation/parse trees.

## Formal Definition for CFG’s

Context-free grammar is used to generate all possible strings in a given formal language. It is defined as a 4-tuple (V, Σ, R, S), where

1. V is a finite set called variables
2. Σ is a finite set which is disjoint from V, called terminals
3. R is a finite set of rules, with each rule being a variable and a string of variables and terminals
4. S ∈ V is the start variable

A set of substitution rules, known as production rules, forms the basis of grammar. Each rule is represented as a line in the grammar and consists of a symbol and a string connected by an arrow. The symbol, known as a variable, is typically denoted by a capital letter, while the string comprises variables and other symbols called terminals. Terminals are similar to the input alphabet and are usually represented by lowercase letters, numbers, or special symbols. Among the variables, one variable is chosen as the start variable.

### Deriving a string from a Grammar

Grammar is used to describe a language by generating each string of that language in the following way - 

1. Begin by noting down the start variable, which is the variable specified on the left-hand side of the top rule, unless specified otherwise.
2. Identify a variable that has been noted down and locate a rule that starts with that particular variable. Substitute the noted variable with the right-hand side of that rule.
3. Repeat step 2 until there are no remaining variables.

### Parse Trees

Parse trees or derivation trees are graphical representations for the derivations of the production rules for a given CFG. They are representative of how the derivation can be done to obtain a string from a given set of production rules. They contain the following properties- 

1. The root node always represents the start symbol.
2. The derivation is read in a left-to-right fashion.
3. The leaf node is always the terminal node.
4. The interior nodes are always the non-terminal nodes

# Experiments

### Reading Parse Trees

For a given derivation tree, Imagine you are traversing a tree using depth-first search (in the order: `dfs(leftmost_child),… dfs(rightmost_child)`. Then, keep track of all the terminal nodes you come across in this process. 

### Example

Construct a parse tree for `p*q+r`, given the following production rules-

```jsx
    E = E + E  
    E = E * E  
    E = p | q | r
```

The construction process is as follows:

p*q+r

### **Ambiguity in CFGs**

Ambiguous CFGs refer to context-free grammars where there exist more than one derivation tree for a given input string. This implies that there can exist multiple Left Most Derivation Trees or Right Most Derivation Trees for a single input. Ambiguity in grammars can be removed by re-writing the grammar without ambiguity, as there is no method to automatically detect and remove it. 

### Experiment 1

Construct a derivation tree for the string `aabbabba` for the CFG given by - 

```jsx
    S → aB | bA  
    A → a | aS | bAA  
    B → b | bS | aBB
```

The derivation tree:

### Experiment 2

Show the derivation tree for string "`aabbbb`" with the following grammar - 

```jsx
    S → AB | ε  
    A → aB  
    B → Sb
```

The derivation tree:

# Applications

1. Syntactic Parsing: Derivation trees are used in syntactic parsing to analyze the grammatical structure of sentences and determine syntactic relationships between words and phrases.
2. Language Generation: Derivation trees aid in generating grammatically correct sentences by following the production rules defined in a grammar.
3. Machine Translation: Derivation trees help align syntactic units between source and target language sentences, improving the accuracy and coherence of machine translations.
4. Error Analysis and Debugging: Derivation trees assist in identifying and addressing errors in language processing systems by examining the specific steps or rules that led to the error.
5. Grammar Optimization: Derivation trees help analyze the structure and efficiency of grammars, guiding the optimization of redundant or inefficient production rules.
6. Language Modeling: Derivation trees support probabilistic language modeling by assigning probabilities to production rules, enabling the estimation of sentence likelihoods for various natural language processing tasks.

# Some Questions and Answers

**Q:What is the difference between a language and a grammar in automata theory?**

A: In automata theory, a language is a set of strings that follow a specific set of rules. It represents the collection of all valid or accepted strings within a given formal system. The language defines what strings are considered "correct" or "valid" within a particular context.

On the other hand, a grammar is a formal system used to define and analyze languages. It consists of a set of production rules that specify how valid strings in the language can be generated. A grammar provides the structure and rules for constructing strings within a language.

**Q: How does the hierarchical relationship manifest in grammars and languages? (Both formal languages, and natural languages- like the ones humans speak)**

A: The hierarchical relationship in grammars and languages refers to the nested structure of linguistic elements, such as phrases, clauses, and sentences. It organizes these elements in a hierarchical manner, with larger units encompassing smaller units, enabling the systematic construction and analysis of language structures.

---

**Q: How do ambiguity and conflicts in production rules affect the construction of derivation trees?**
A: Ambiguity and conflicts in production rules can result in multiple possible derivation trees for a given string. This makes the construction of derivation trees more complex, requiring additional techniques such as precedence or associativity rules to resolve the ambiguity.

---

**Q: Is the construction of derivation trees a deterministic or random process?**
A: The construction of derivation trees is deterministic, as it follows a specific set of rules and production choices in a CFG. The process is not random, and each derivation tree corresponds to a specific derivation of a string.

**Q: How do parse trees differ from Abstract Syntax Trees?**

**Note:** Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) represent the essential structure and meaning of the input, abstracting away unnecessary syntactic details and focusing on the high-level structure and semantic relationships between the program's components.

| Parse Tree | Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) |
| --- | --- |
| Represents the complete syntactic structure of the input based on grammar rules. | Represents the essential structure and meaning of the input, abstracting away unnecessary syntactic details. |
| Captures all the grammatical derivations and includes every production rule and intermediate step. | Removes redundant information, such as parentheses and operator precedence. |
| Contains all the details, such as parentheses and operator precedence. | Focuses on the high-level structure and semantic relationships between the program's components. |
| Typically larger and more detailed compared to ASTs. | Typically smaller and more concise compared to parse trees. |
