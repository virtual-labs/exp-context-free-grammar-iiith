Context-Free Grammars form the core of the formal languages and automata course. In this context, derivation relates strings to grammars via parse trees. By carrying out a derivation via an experiment, the student could understand the three important aspects of derivation: locating a non-terminal in the parse tree, finding a matching a rule in the CFG for the non-terminal, carrying out the substitution process by replacing the non-terminal with a subtree.
